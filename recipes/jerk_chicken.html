        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There are as many takes on jerk chicken in Jamaica as there are cooks on the island, but most share the same method: Chicken is coated in a seasoning mixture dominated by spices and chiles, then grilled. This version comes from Paul Chung, a self-taught cook of Chinese and Jamaican descent who worked in the mail room at Food & Wine. It's wonderfully spicy, smoky, and fragrant â€” everything you want jerk chicken to be.</p>
        
        <p>But what puts this one above all others? The key is including five-spice powder in the marinade, a Chinese spice blend made of cinnamon, fennel seed, cloves, Sichuan peppercorns and star anise. "This spark of cinnamon enhances the rich clove flavor imparted by the allspice berries," former F&W test kitchen supervisor Marcia Kiesel wrote.</p>
