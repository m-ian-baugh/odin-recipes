        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There are as many takes on jerk chicken in Jamaica as there are cooks on the island, but most share the same method: Chicken is coated in a seasoning mixture dominated by spices and chiles, then grilled. This version comes from Paul Chung, a self-taught cook of Chinese and Jamaican descent who worked in the mail room at Food & Wine. It's wonderfully spicy, smoky, and fragrant â€” everything you want jerk chicken to be.</p>
        
        <p>But what puts this one above all others? The key is including five-spice powder in the marinade, a Chinese spice blend made of cinnamon, fennel seed, cloves, Sichuan peppercorns and star anise. "This spark of cinnamon enhances the rich clove flavor imparted by the allspice berries," former F&W test kitchen supervisor Marcia Kiesel wrote.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium onion, coarsely chopped</li>            
            <li>3 medium scallions, chopped</li>
            <li>2 Scotch bonnet chiles, chopped</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon five-spice powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon allspice berries, coarsely ground</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme, crumbled</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 (3 1/2 to 4-pound) chickens, quartered</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a food processor, combine the onion, scallions, chiles, garlic, five-spice powder, allspice, pepper, thyme, nutmeg, and salt; process to a coarse paste. With the machine on, add the soy sauce and oil in a steady stream. Pour the marinade into a large, shallow dish, add the chicken, and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Bring the chicken to room temperature before proceeding.</li>
            <li>Light a grill. Grill the chicken over a medium-hot fire, turning occasionally, until well browned and cooked through, 35 to 40 minutes. (Cover the grill for a smokier flavor.) Transfer the chicken to a platter and serve.</li>
        </ol>
