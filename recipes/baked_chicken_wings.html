            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>10 chicken wings</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the oil and seasonings in a bag and shake to blend.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken wings to the bag, seal and shake to coat.</li>
            <li>Arrange the wings on a baking sheet and bake until crisp and cooked through.</li>
