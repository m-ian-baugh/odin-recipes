        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Roast beef made with round roast cooked to your liking using an easy, weight-based formula guide for perfect results every time. Thinly slice the beef and serve with gravy, mashed potatoes, and your veggie of choice for a special family meal. Use the juices from the roast beef in your gravy.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 pounds beef eye of round roast, at room temperature</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder, or more to taste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Make sure roast is at room temperature. Tie roast at 3-inch intervals with cotton twine; this helps it from drying out
            and allows it to cook more evenly. Place roast on a rack in a baking pan.</li>
            <li>Mix together salt, garlic powder, and pepper in a small bowl. Rub seasoning mixture into the meat.</li>
            <li>Place in the preheated oven and roast for 60 minutes, or 20 minutes per pound if your roast is larger or smaller. An
            instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 120 to 125 degrees F (49 to 52 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Cover loosely with foil, and let rest so juices can redistribute,
            15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Slice and serve.</li>
        </ol>
